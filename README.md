Password generator created for client.  Creates a password between 8-128 characters, using upper and lower case letters, numbers,
and special characters. Prompts should appear giving the client the choice to select the criteria of length of password, then 
character types, and then password will appear in the display written to the page.  This was created using javascript in combination 
with the html and css you gave us to use.
